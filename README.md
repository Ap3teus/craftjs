# CraftJS

Spigot Plugin that allows programming custom functionality for your server using Javascript. Inspired heavily by [ScriptCraft](https://github.com/walterhiggins/ScriptCraft) but trying to address some of it's issues.

## Getting Started

Currently the only way to obtain the plugin jar is to build it from the source.

### Building

0. Make sure you have `maven` installed
1. Run `mvn install`
2. Copy the built jar from `target` to your server's plugins-folder
